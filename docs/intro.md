# Rapido Partner Integration Docs

A comprehensive integration guide for Rapido's Partner PWA Integration platform. This documentation is designed to help partner engineers seamlessly integrate their Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) into the Rapido ecosystem.

## Who This Documentation Is For

This documentation is specifically created for:
- **Partner engineers** looking to integrate PWA applications with Rapido
- **Backend developers** implementing server-to-server authentication
- **Frontend developers** working with Rapido's JavaScript Bridge
- **Technical leads** planning PWA integrations

## What You'll Achieve

By following this integration guide, you'll be able to:

✅ **Seamless User Authentication** - Implement Single Sign-On (SSO) that allows Rapido users to access your PWA without additional login steps

✅ **Secure Token Management** - Handle user authentication tokens securely using Rapido's encrypted session management

✅ **User Consent Management** - Respect user privacy with Rapido's built-in consent mechanism

✅ **Session Persistence** - Maintain user sessions across app launches using secure session ID storage

✅ **Backend Integration** - Validate user tokens and fetch user details through Rapido's server APIs

## Single Sign-On (SSO) Overview

Rapido's SSO capability enables a frictionless user experience by:

- **Eliminating repeated logins** - Users authenticated in Rapido can access partner PWAs instantly
- **Secure token exchange** - All authentication tokens are encrypted and have limited validity
- **User consent first** - Users explicitly approve data sharing with partner applications
- **Seamless integration** - Minimal code changes required in your existing PWA
